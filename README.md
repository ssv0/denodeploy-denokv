# denodeploy-inmemory
In memory earthstar server to be used with sneakspeak that can be deployed and configured by denodeploy (https://deno.land) which has a free tier.
NOTE: connecting to this server means connecting to a new empty instance of it most of the times, so it can only be used to check whether synchronization works.
To deploy add the environmental variable SETTINGSSHARE containing the address of the share that contains the standard server settings, see earthstar docs for info.
